This section of the course "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" did not have a final project.
This section was an introduction to Javascript. All of the topics covered were programming concepts that I
was already familiar with in Python, and for me this lesson was more of an introduction to the formatting
and stylistic choices used in Javascript.
